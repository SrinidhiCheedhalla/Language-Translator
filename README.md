Introduction:
Translation is a medium to transfer the knowledge or information. It can be a bridge which connects the people from the different languages and cultures. By using translation, people can learn and understand each otherâ€™s languages and cultures. Translation is not merely at changing words, but also transferring of cultural equivalence with the culture of the original language and the recipient of that language as well as possible. The better translation must be accepted by all people in logic and based on fact; thus, the message which contained in the source language (SL) can satisfy the target language (TL) reader with the information within.
